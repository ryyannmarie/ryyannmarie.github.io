        <h4>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timely_Comics">Timely Comics</a></h4>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp-magazine">Pulp-magazine</a> publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Goodman_(publisher)">Martin Goodman</a> created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939.<a href="#bottom">[4]</a><a href="bottom">[5]</a> Goodman, who had started with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_fiction">Western</a> pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing">editor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_editor">managing editor</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_manager">business manager</a>, with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother)<a href="#bottom">[6]</a> officially listed as publisher.<a href="#bottom">[5]</a></p>
        <p>Timely's first publication, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Mystery_Comics">Marvel Comics</a> #1 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_date">cover dated</a> Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Burgos">Carl Burgos'</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)">android</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero">superhero</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Torch_(android)">Human Torch</a>, and the first appearances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Everett">Bill Everett</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-hero">anti-hero</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namor">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>,<a href="#bottom">[7]</a> among other features.<a href="#bottom">[4]</a> The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. While its contents came from an outside packager, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funnies,_Inc.">Funnies, Inc.</a>,<a href="#bottom">[4]</a> Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Simon">Joe Simon</a>, teamed with artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby">Jack Kirby</a> to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes,<a href="#bottom">[9]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America">Captain America</a>, in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million.<a href="#bottom">[8]</a> Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.<a href="#bottom">[2][10]</a></p>
        <p>While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes—many of which continue to appear in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity">modern-day</a> retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whizzer_(Robert_Frank)">Whizzer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_America_(Madeline_Joyce)">Miss America</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(Keen_Marlow)">Destroyer</a>, the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_(Timely_Comics)">Vision</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_(Thomas_Halloway)">Angel</a>. Timely also published one of humor cartoonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Wolverton">Basil Wolverton</a>'s best-known features, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerhouse_Pepper">Powerhouse Pepper</a>",<a href="#bottom">[11][12]</a> as well as a line of children's funny-animal comics featuring characters like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Rabbit">Super Rabbit</a> and the duo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Pig_and_Silly_Seal">Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal</a>.</p>
        <p>Goodman hired his wife's 16-year-old cousin,<a href="#bottom">[13]</a> Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939.<a href="#bottom">[14]</a> When editor Simon left the company in late 1941,<a href="#bottom">[15]</a> Goodman made Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as "Stan Lee"—interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in World War II. Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles.</p>
        <p>Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff.<a href="#bottom">[2]</a> One of these shell companies through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled "A Marvel Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961.<a href="#bottom">[16]</a></p>

        <h4>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Comics_(1950s)">Atlas Comics (1950s)</a></h4>
        <p>The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion.<a href="#bottom">[17]</a> Goodman's comic book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even Timely had published, featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction">horror</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerns">Westerns</a>, humor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_animal">funny animal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_adventure">men's adventure</a>-drama, giant monster, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction">crime</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_comics">war comics</a>, and later adding jungle books, romance titles, espionage, and even medieval adventure, Bible stories and sports.</p>
        <p>Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned,<a href="#bottom">[18]</a> on comics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-date">cover-dated</a> November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues.<a href="#bottom">[19]</a> This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications.<a href="#bottom">[20]</a></p>
        <p>Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following popular trends in television and movies—Westerns and war dramas prevailing for a time, drive-in movie monsters another time—and even other comic books, particularly the EC horror line.<a href="#bottom">[21]</a> Atlas also published a plethora of children's and teen humor titles, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_DeCarlo">Dan DeCarlo</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_the_Happy_Ghost">Homer the Happy Ghost</a> (similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a>) and Homer Hooper (à la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Andrews_(comics)">Archie Andrews</a>). Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by Syd Shores and Dick Ayers, variously), the Sub-Mariner (drawn and most stories written by Bill Everett), and Captain America (writer Stan Lee, artist John Romita Sr.). Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and, according to Stan Lee, Atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly, cheaply, and at a passable quality.<a href="#bottom">[22]</a></p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_01_Cover.jpg">
        <p>The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science-fiction">science-fiction</a> anthology <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_into_Mystery">Journey into Mystery</a> #69 and the teen-humor title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Walker">Patsy Walker</a> #95 (both cover dated June 1961), which each displayed an "MC" box on its cover.<a href="#bottom">[23]</a> Then, in the wake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comics</a>' success in reviving superheroes in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)">Flash</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Jordan">Green Lantern</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Wayne">Batman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent">Superman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Prince">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Queen">Green Arrow</a> and other members of the team the Justice League of America, Marvel followed suit.</p>
        <p>In 1961, writer-editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">Stan Lee</a> revolutionized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero">superhero</a> comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to older readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium, thus ushering what Marvel later called the Marvel Age of Comics.<a href="#bottom">[24]</a> Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four_(comic_book)">The Fantastic Four</a> #1 (Nov. 1961),<a href="#bottom">[25]</a> broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated.<a href="#bottom">[26]</a> This applied to The Amazing Spider-Man title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book. Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager, something with which many readers could identify.</p>
        <p>Stan Lee and freelance artist and eventual co-plotter Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four originated in a Cold War culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age.<a href="#bottom">[27]</a> Eschewing such comic-book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a "superheroes in the real world" approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success.<a href="#bottom">[28]</a></p>
        <p>Marvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits—unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books. Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hulk">the Hulk</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(comics)">the Thing</a>. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(literature)">naturalistic </a>approach even extended into topical politics.</p>
        <p>Comics historian Mike Benton also noted:</p>
        <p>In the world of [rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comics</a>'] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Superman</a> comic books, communism did not exist. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes.<a href="#bottom">[29]</a> From 1962 to 1965, there were more communists [in Marvel Comics] than on the subscription list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda">Pravda</a>. Communist agents attack Ant-Man in his laboratory, red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong">Viet Cong</a> guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man.<a href="#bottom">[30]</a></p>
        <p>All these elements struck a chord with the older readers, including college-aged adults. In 1965, Spider-Man and the Hulk were both featured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)">Esquire</a> magazine's list of 28 college campus heroes, alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>.<a href="#bottom">[31]</a> In 2009, writer Geoff Boucher reflected that,</p>
        <p>Superman and DC Comics instantly seemed like boring old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Boone">Pat Boone</a>; Marvel felt like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beatles</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Invasion">British Invasion</a>. It was Kirby's artwork with its tension and psychedelia that made it perfect for the times—or was it Lee's bravado and melodrama, which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time?<a href="#bottom">[32]</a>

        <p>In addition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> and the Fantastic Four, Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk">Hulk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)">Thor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Pym">Ant-Man</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">Iron Man</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men">X-Men</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics_character)">Daredevil</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhumans">Inhumans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics)">Black Panther</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Marvel_(Marvel_Comics)">Captain Marvel</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer">Silver Surfer</a>, and such memorable antagonists as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom">Doctor Doom</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto_(Marvel_Comics)">Magneto</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactus">Galactus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(comics)">Loki</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Goblin">Green Goblin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Octopus">Doctor Octopus</a>, all existing in a shared reality known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe">Marvel Universe</a>, with locations that mirror real-life cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.</p>

        <p>In 1968, while selling 50 million comic books a year, company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years, allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted.<a href="#bottom">[18]</a> Late that year, he sold Marvel Comics and its parent company, Magazine Management, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_Industries">Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation</a>, with Goodman remaining as publisher.<a href="#bottom">[34]</a> In 1969, Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Circulation">Curtis Circulation Company</a>.<a href="#bottom">[18]</a></p>
        <p>In 1971, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services">United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare</a> approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee">Stan Lee</a> to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. However, the industry's self-censorship board, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority">Comics Code Authority</a>, refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant. Lee, with Goodman's approval, published the story regardless in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> #96–98 (May–July 1971), without the Comics Code seal. The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year.<a href="#bottom">[35]</a></p>
        <p>Goodman retired as publisher in 1972 and installed his son, Chip, as publisher.<a href="#bottom">[36]</a> Shortly thereafter, Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvel's president<a href="#bottom">[36]</a> for a brief time.<a href="#bottom">[37]</a> During his time as president, he appointed his associate editor, prolific writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Thomas">Roy Thomas</a>, as editor-in-chief. Thomas added "Stan Lee Presents" to the opening page of each comic book.<a href="#bottom">[36]</a></p>

        <p>A series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry. Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code published titles themed to horror (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tomb_of_Dracula">The Tomb of Dracula</a>), martial arts (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Kung_Fu_(comics)">Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword-and-sorcery">sword-and-sorcery</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_(Marvel_Comics)">Conan the Barbarian</a> in 1970,<a href="#bottom">[38]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sonja">Red Sonja</a>), satire (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_the_Duck">Howard the Duck</a>) and science fiction (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(comics)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killraven">Killraven</a>" in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Adventures">Amazing Adventures</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(comics)">Battlestar Galactica</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(comics)">Star Trek</a>, and, late in the decade, the long-running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(1977_comic_book)">Star Wars</a> series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Magazines">Curtis Magazines imprint</a>.</p>
        <p>Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comics</a> in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux.<a href="#bottom">[39]</a> Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount.<a href="#bottom">[40]</a></p>
        <p>In 1973, Perfect Film and Chemical renamed itself as Cadence Industries and renamed Magazine Management as Marvel Comics Group.<a href="#bottom">[41]</a> Goodman, now disconnected from Marvel, set up a new company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas/Seaboard_Comics">Seaboard Periodicals</a> in 1974, reviving Marvel's old Atlas name for a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas/Seaboard_Comics">Atlas Comics</a> line, but this lasted only a year and a half.<a href="#bottom">[42]</a> In the mid-1970s a decline of the newsstand distribution network affected Marvel. Cult hits such as Howard the Duck fell victim to the distribution problems, with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later date. But by the end of the decade, Marvel's fortunes were reviving, thanks to the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_market">direct market</a> distribution—selling through those same comics-specialty stores instead of newsstands.</p>
        <p>Marvel ventured into audio in 1975 with a radio series and a record, both had Stan Lee as narrator. The radio series was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four#In_other_media">Fantastic Four</a>. The record was Spider-Man: Rock Reflections of a Superhero concept album for music fans.<a href="#bottom">[43]</a></p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/08/Secretwars1.png">
        <p>Marvel held its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_convention">comic book convention</a>, Marvelcon '75, in spring 1975, and promised a Marvelcon '76. At the 1975 event, Stan Lee used a <a href="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a> panel discussion to announce that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby">Jack Kirby</a>, the artist co-creator of most of Marvel's signature characters, was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comics</a>.<a href="#bottom">[45]</a> In October 1976, Marvel, which already licensed reprints in different countries, including the UK, created a superhero specifically for the British market. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Britain">Captain Britain</a> debuted exclusively in the UK, and later appeared in American comics.<a href="#bottom">[46]</a> During this time, Marvel and the Iowa-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_and_Tribune_Syndicate">Register and Tribune Syndicate</a> launched a number of syndicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strips">comic strips</a> — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(comic_strip)">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_the_Duck">Howard the Duck</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian_(comics)">Conan the Barbarian</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Hulk_(comic_strip)">The Incredible Hulk</a>. None of the strips lasted past 1982, except for The Amazing Spider-Man, which is still being published.</p>
        <p>In 1978, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Shooter">Jim Shooter</a> became Marvel's editor-in-chief. Although a controversial personality, Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, including repeatedly missed deadlines. During Shooter's nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Claremont">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Byrne_(comics)">John Byrne</a>'s run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_X-Men">Uncanny X-Men</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics)">Frank Miller</a>'s run on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics_series)">Daredevil</a> became critical and commercial successes.<a href="#bottom">[47]</a> Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_market">direct market</a>,<a href="#bottom">[48]</a> institutionalized creator royalties, starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Comics">Epic Comics</a> imprint for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_ownership">creator-owned</a> material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover story arcs with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Hero_Contest_of_Champions">Contest of Champions</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars">Secret Wars</a>; and in 1986 launched the ultimately unsuccessful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Universe">New Universe</a> line to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Comics">Star Comics</a>, a children-oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles, was briefly successful during this period.</p>

As Stan Lee recalls, 'Martin Goodman would say, "Stan, let's do a different kind of book," and it was usually based on how the competition was doing. When we found that EC's horror books were doing well, for instance, we published a lot of horror books'".</p></li>

            <li><p>Comics historian Greg Theakston has suggested that the decision to include monsters and initially to distance the new breed of superheroes from costumes was a conscious one, and born of necessity. Since DC distributed Marvel's output at the time, Theakston theorizes that, "Goodman and Lee decided to keep their superhero line looking as much like their horror line as they possibly could," downplaying "the fact that [Marvel] was now creating heroes" with the effect that they ventured "into deeper waters, where DC had never considered going".
